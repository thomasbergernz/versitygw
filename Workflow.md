### S3 Client Request
The workflow starts when an S3 client sends an S3 API request to the S3 Gateway Server. This request is an S3 API operation such as PutObject or GetObject.

### Translation to Backend Operation
Upon receiving the request, the S3 Gateway Server translates the S3 request into a corresponding backend operation. The request is handed to the backend module based on which backend type is currently selected.

### Backend Processing
The backend system then processes the operation based on how that specific storage system should handle the request.

### Sending Results
Once the backend operation is completed, the backend system sends the result back through the frontend component.

### S3 API Response
The Gateway Server then translates the result into an S3 API response and sends this back to the S3 client.

### Continuation of Requests
This sequence continues for every request from the S3 client until the entire workload is completed. As a result, the S3 client can effectively communicate with the backend storage system via the S3 Gateway Server, ensuring a seamless workflow.
