The Versity Gateway serves as a bridge between file-based storage systems and applications that rely on S3 object interfaces. It enables applications to interact with file storage using familiar S3 operations like put and get, allowing for easy integration and compatibility. Built from scratch in Go, a highly efficient programming language known for its performance and scalability, the Versity Gateway leverages Go's benefits to deliver exceptional speed and efficiency.

* It is designed to meet the community's need for a reliable open source, high-performance object to file translation tool

* The Versity Gateway provides seamless file storage access for S3-based applications, enabling compatibility with legacy systems and offering scalability for demanding workloads

* The Open Source Versity Gateway is an Apache 2.0 open-source project

* It is developed collaboratively by Versity, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre.
